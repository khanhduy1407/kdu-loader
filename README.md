# kdu-loader

> Kdu component loader for [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

**NOTE: the master branch (9.0+) only works with Kdu 2.x.**

The best way to get started is with [kdu-cli](https://github.com/khanhduy1407/kdu-cli):

``` js
npm install -g kdu-cli
kdu init webpack-simple hello
cd hello
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will setup a basic Webpack + `kdu-loader` project for you, with `*.kdu` files and hot-reloading working out of the box!

For advanced `kdu-loader` configuration, checkout the [documentation](https://khanhduy1407.github.io/kdu-loader).
